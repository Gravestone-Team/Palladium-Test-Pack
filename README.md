# Palladium Test Pack
originally made by lucas, this test pack is a documented example of as many palladium features as we can work out


Hi! DeadedAndZen here,

couple of things i'd like to say

this is the original test pack mostly. things will definitly look different from the one thats in the actual palladium git because we are gonna add to it BUT the idea is that this is a more easily accessible version of the test pack for people to use and also just covers more features.

feel free to contribute to the pack :D id love getting help as there are absolutely parts of palladium that i just DONT understand at all.

this will always only use palladium features, nothing specific to any addon or things extra, however it will also cover things like geckolib and kubejs compatability features


obviously also take a look at the palladium wiki as there will be things that we do not cover that are mentioned over there because i dont want to cover EVERY SINGLE TINY FEATURE within one ability (that sounds like a massive waste of space ;-;)

<summary># Rules</summary>

Hey so obviously gonna need some rules, these will be added to and changed over time


-do not put in features from other peoples addons. this is palladium only strictly

-do not make a really complex example of a feature, thats just not needed

-when making an example that uses assets that you have not created, please list somewhere the place that you got that asset from

-do not edit the README.md or pack.mcmeta
</details>



if you are looking for the example test pack for Gravestone: Core features then wrong place, that doesnt exist yet sorry :(
